        Hi, I'm <span class="font-semibold">Bunyamin</span> — a fullstack developer with a unique
        background in law, sales and front end developing skills. I started my career at the public
        prosecutor’s office, where I developed a strong foundation in justice and security. Now, I
        apply that experience as a developer within the police, building secure digital systems. I'm
        motivated about solving real-world problems through technology — with a focus on front-end
        languages.
